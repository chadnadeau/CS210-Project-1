# CS210-Project-1

Summary
-In this project I had to create two clocks that were displayed, one in 12 hour time and one in 24 hour time.
-Along with the two clocks I had to create a menu that displays giving the user the option to add and hour, add a minute, add a second or exit the program entirely.

What did I do well?
-In this project I feel as if i did a particularly good job at organizing the asterisks around the clock and menu that were displayed.

Where could I enhance?
-While looking at the code, it definitely could use some touch up in areas that are spread out, i.e. making things more neat and tidy.

What did I find most challenging?
-Personally I found getting all of the asterisks to line up properly and display, although I did so successfully, it definitely took some time to get right. 
-Messing around with the code and taking the time to understand how it worked helped me in the long run and was a good way to teach me patience.

What skills are transferable?
-The entire project structure taught me that there are multiple ways to do things but sometimes finding the simplest most efficient way is most practical.
-Not over complicating something that does not need to be is extremely important, and this project helped me understand that.

How did you make it readable?
-Back to keeping it simple yet efficient, having the code still be readable yet effective made it easier to program, and also maintain in the future if i ever feel the desire to go back and change something or add something.
